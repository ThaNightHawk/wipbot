# WIPbot for Beat Saber streamers

> [!NOTE]
> Required BeatSaberPlus or CatCore.  
> Make sure your channel moderation settings allow posting links in chat, otherwise only VIPs and above can post wip download links.  
> Request codes obtained from the dedicated website can be used 99.9% of the time. (Unless Cloudflare or Oracle Cloud dies)

~~I also won't cry, bitch and moan, ultimately ending up defacing my own website and plastering it with furryporn, like some fucking weirdo.~~

### This plugin adds the ``!wip`` command to your Twitch chat.  
Examples:  
``!wip`` prints a help message in chat  
``!wip e5a5bb`` using a request code obtained from https://wip.thnght.pro/  
``!wip https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/9106712553161/9165053429928/Example_Wip.zip`` using Discord  
``!wip https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rcs9V_aq1kBjNhAQUdFz7f7kvWR/view?usp=sharing`` using Google Drive  
``!wip oops`` removes users most recent request from queue

After someone has requested a wip, press the WIP button to download it:
